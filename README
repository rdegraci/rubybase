rubybase is a small project for hacking together quick and dirty ActiveRecord Ruby tools, with support for a console, rspec, and cucumber. Tests are run via SQLite in-memory database and development uses Postgresql 


DATABASE

Edit the db/config.yaml with the appropriate values to connect to your Postgresql database


DATABASE CONSOLE

rake console


TESTS

rake or rake test


NOTE:

If you get the following error, cannot load such file -- rubybase/spec/../db/schema.rb (LoadError) you'll need to run rake db:migrate to create the schema.rb


MIGRATIONS

To create a new database migration:

rake db:new_migration name=foo_bar_migration
edit db/migrate/20081220234130_foo_bar_migration.rb

rake db:migrate
To migrate to a specific version (for example to rollback), defaults to development

rake db:migrate VERSION=20081220234130
To migrate a specific database (for example your "testing" database)

rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
To execute a specific up/down of one single migration, defaults to development

rake db:migrate:up VERSION=20081220234130
To revert your last migration

rake db:rollback
To revert your last 3 migrations

rake db:rollback STEP=3


ACTIVERECORD

After running a migration, you will need to add a class in the /lib directory that will represent your ActiveRecord class. 
For example:


# lib/Apple.rb
class Apple < ActiveRecord::Base
end



- After creating the class, you can do: rake console to access the database
